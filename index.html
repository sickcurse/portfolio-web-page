      <h2 id="about"> About Me </h2>
      <p> 
          My name is Marquan White, the future of the digital age. I'm born and rasied Brooklyn, NY. I purchased a really sick hat in Hong Kong and, I haven't been to Philly.

      <p> 
        When I was a kid, bout 5, 8, I had this magical moment with my Dad. When my mother and sisters lived out in Canarise, 
        we lived on the last house on the block. A large feild streached the rest of the Cal-di-sac. 
        When he came to visit one day we walked into the tall stalks. Stalks taller than my him. Mud deep, as I pulled my leg free with each step.
        This was one of a few encounters I had with my father so young that showed me how much of a kid he was too. 
        At the end of the forest of tall stalks and muddy shoes was a highway that strecthed further than I could grasp, a vomit like shore that pushed up against the grass,
        and a bottle cap still bright and red. It had belonged to coke-ca-cola. Just as the magic was beginning to take me my father spoke,
        told me to "come along" as he was deepening back into the swamp.
